## Description
#### This website provides a form that takes in user input of an amount in USD as well as the selection of a currency type to exchange the amount to. When the user clicks submit, the results display the value of the USD amount after having been exchanged to the selected currency type. This is done using a currency exchange API. If the API call doesn't go through, an error will be thrown to the console and displayed in the DOM. If there is a selected currency that isn't one of the 5 available as options, an error message will display in the DOM.
